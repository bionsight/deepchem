        "# Tutorial Part 20: Converting DeepChem models to TensorFlow Estimators\n",
        "\n",
        "So far, we've walked through a lot of the scientific details tied to molecular machine learning, but we haven't discussed as much how to use tools like DeepChem in production settings. This tutorial (and the last) focus more on the practical matters of how to use DeepChem in production settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "When DeepChem was first created, Tensorflow had no standard interface for datasets or models.  We created the Dataset and Model classes to fill this hole.  More recently, Tensorflow has added the `tf.data` module as a standard interface for datasets, and the `tf.estimator` module as a standard interface for models.  To enable easy interoperability with other tools, we have added features to Dataset and Model to support these new standards. Using the Estimator interface may make it easier to deply DeepChem models in production environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "This example demonstrates how to use these features.  Let's begin by loading a dataset and creating a model to analyze it.  We'll use a simple MultitaskClassifier with one hidden layer.\n",
